# Supported Tokens

Learn which tokens are supported by DePay and what requirements custom tokens need to fulfill.

## List

DePay's permissionless, decentralized payment routing protocol supports all tokens fulfilling the requirements (see [requirements](#requirements)).

Please check [DePay's Website > About > Tokens](https://depay.com/tokens) in order to check which tokens are currently supported exactly.

## Requirements

In order for a token to be supported by DePay, that token needs to be a standard token (e.g. ERC20, BEP20 etc.). Any customizations or additions to the token standard are not supported by DePay. The token also needs to have a pair (liquidity pool) on a supported decentralized exchange (see [supported exchanges](/docs/payments/supported/exchanges)) with **at least USD 10k** reserves in order to be convertible with DePay.
